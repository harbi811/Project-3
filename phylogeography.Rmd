The data comprises of an alignment of sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from around the world. The aim of this analysis was to estimate the ancestral locations of the virus using a Bayesian discrete phylogeographic approach.

## Running BEAUTi
The alignment in FASTA format was converted to an BEAST XML input file using BEAUTi (Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Utility) program.

The data was imported into BEAUTi using `File -> Import Data`.
On the `Tips` tab, the box labelled `Use tip dates`. The sequences have their date of sampling encoded in their labels. The `Parse Dates` button at the top of the `Tips` panel was used
